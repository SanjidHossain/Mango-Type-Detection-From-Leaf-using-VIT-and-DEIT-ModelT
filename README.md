# Mango-Type-Detection-From-Leaf-using-VIT-and-DEIT-ModelT
A Computer Vision project using Vision architecture to detect the Type of Mango from Mango Leaf Images 
# Mango Type Detection from Leaf using VIT and DEIT Model

## Project Overview
This project utilizes Vision Transformer (ViT) and Data-efficient Image Transformers (DeiT) models to detect and classify different types of mango leaves. The aim is to provide an efficient and accurate system for identifying mango leaf diseases.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing is available on Google Drive. You can access it [here](YOUR_DATASET_LINK).

## Insight & BenchMark
Current Model was analyzed based on a very small version of the actual dataset that contained over 10,0000 data, However the small version contained less than 600 to check the effeciency of the models on a smaller number. Between these 2 models, the perfomance was better on DEIT model in terms of accuracy for the small dataset which met the expectation of the Data effecienc of DeIT model.


## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SanjidHossain/Mango-Type-Detection-From-Leaf-using-VIT-and-DEIT-ModelT.git
cd Mango-Type-Detection-From-Leaf-using-VIT-and-DEIT-ModelT
```
Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To Train the model
```bash
Run the VIT Model or DEIT Model
```
